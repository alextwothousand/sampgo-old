# SA-MP Plugin SDK

This is a copy of the SA-MP plugin SDK files extracted from MapAndreas (a plugin by Kalcor). It is the bare minium that you need to develop plugins. 

The plugin SDK used to be hosted on the SA-MP website but was removed for some reason, hence this repo was born. 

Please don't submit pull requests.
